# Introduction to datasets

In this project we are aiming to use various datasets and sometimes a combination of them. A problem is that all datasets comes under different file/folder structure.

The idea is to create a single file/folder structure that could be interpreted by the machine learning algortihm. This file convention will be named **Data Source Convention**

## Data Source Convention

1. dataset is split into `/test` and `/train`
2. inside `/test` or `/train`, subfolders must represent label names
3. names and file extensiosn do not matter

Sample structure would look like
- `/datasets`
  - `/test`
    - `/covid`
    - `/normal`
    - `/pneumonia`
  - `/train`
    - `/covid`
    - `/normal`
    - `/pneumonia`
