### Implemented features:
- save trained model with models/save_my_model() func
- load trained model with models/load_my_model() func


### Features to deliver:
- average image pixel analysis (sample 1000-2000 images and reference Central limit Thoerem)
- create utility function to draw Confusion matrix for selected model
- explore Tensorboard and check if we can log "Confussion matrixes"
- Keras Tuner to tune my models
- experiment using lower precision variables (flaot16) to reduce memory usage. Save screenshots of evidence. How does it effect traning speed (compare before and after)
- cleaning outlier images in dataset? Is that possible? Experiment. How does it improve accuracy?
- add more metrics to model when training
- Add model for transfer learning - `Alex Net`
- Add model for transfer learning - `Efficient Net`
- Add model for transfer learning - `Mobile Net V2`
